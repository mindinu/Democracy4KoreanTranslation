#,AdultEducationSubsidies,성인 교육 보조금,성인 교육 보조금은 근로자가 취업한 후에도 재교육과 학습을 지속할 수 있도록 유도하는 방안이다. 이는 야간 수업과 원격학습 자료를 포함한다. 이러한 계획은 노동력의 전반적인 교육 수준을 높이는 데 도움이 된다.
#,AgricultureSubsidies,농업 보조금,"안보전략적 이유로 몇몇 정부들은 국가의 안정적인 식량 공급을 보장하기 위해 농민들에게 기꺼이 보조금을 지급한다. 이는 자유시장원리에 어긋나고 매우 비쌀 수 있지만 동시에 농부들의 일자리와 표를 지키는 데에도 도움이 된다."
#,AirlineTax,항공유 과세,항공유는 일반적으로 과세 대상이 아니다. 항공유 과세 지지자들은 이러한 조세특례를 환경에 파괴적인 운송수단의 이용을 장려하는 불공정한 특혜라 주장한다. 항공사들은 항공유에 세금이 붙으면 국외에서 급유하는 항공사가 늘어나 국부 유출만 일어날 것이라 지적한다.
#,AlcoholLaw,주류법,"과도한 음주는 건강에 해를 끼치고 심지어는 사망으로도 이어질 수 있다는 증거는 충분하다. 하지만 개인이 무엇을 마시건 국가가 상관할 일이 아니라는 사람들도 있다. 또한 정부가 술에 세금을 매겨서 많은 돈을 벌 수 있다는 문제도 있다."
#,AlcoholTax,주류세,"건강 악화와 각종 사회문제를 야기할 수 있는 알코올 섭취를 줄이기 위해 정부가 술에 세금을 부과해야 함을 지지하는 의학적 논거는 명확하다. 반면에 사회생활을 하면서 가볍게 음주를 하는 사람들은 정부가 주류세로 이익을 보는 것이 위선적이라고 본다."
#,ArmedPolice,무장경찰,경찰을 무장시키는 것은 범죄를 예방하고 질서를 유지하는데 효과적인 전략이 될 수 있다. 반대자들은 되려 범죄자들이 군비경쟁 하듯 경쟁적으로 무장하도록 부추길 것이라 주장한다. 또한 경찰을 무장시킬수록 선량한 시민들은 경찰과 거리감을 느낄 우려가 있다는 비판 역시 제기된다.
#,BanSundayShopping,일요일 상점영업 금지,기독교는 일반적으로 안식일을 휴일이라 보고 많은 교인들은 이 날에는 쇼핑을 해서는 안된다고 믿는다. 또한 일부 노동조합들은 강제휴업이 착취를 막아줄 수 있다고 믿는다.
#,BiofuelSubsidies,바이오연료 보조금,"옥수수에서 추출한 에탄올과 석유 화학 연료를 혼합한 바이오 연료는 석유 수요를 줄일 수 있다. 이것은 일반적으로 환경론자들에게 인기가 있다. 바이오 연료용 옥수수를 생산해 돈을 버는 농부들도 혜택을 받는다. 에탄올이 더 많이 혼합된 바이오 연료는 세금 감면을 통해 보조금을 지원할 수 있다."
#,BorderControls,입국 심사,"국경에서 어떠한 종류의 심사가 이루어지지 않다면, 우리나라는 거대한 불법 이민 문제에 개방되어 있는 것이다. 일각에서는 이 이민자들이 범죄를 일으키고, 그들이 국민들로부터 일자리를 빼앗는다고 주장한다. 국경 통제는 불법 이민을 줄이는 데 효과적일 수 있다."
#,BusLanes,버스 전용 차로제,"버스 전용 차선을 따로 두는 것이 교통 흐름을 더 빠르게 하고 교통 혼잡을 피할 수 있는 한 방법이다. 또한 대중 교통의 이동 시간을 단축시켜 사용을 장려한다. 이런 계획을 세우는 데는 상당한 비용이 들며, 버스 차선이 교통 체증에 갇혀 있는 동안 텅 빈 것처럼 보이면 운전자들이 짜증을 낼 수 있다고 말했다."
#,BusSubsidies,버스 보조금,"교통혼잡과 오염은 사람들이 자동차 대신 버스로 여행하도록 장려함으로써 줄어들 수 있다. 하지만 비싼 선택일 수도 있고, 일부 운전자들은 교통수단을 이용하지 않는 것에 대해 불만을 가질 수도 있습니다."
#,CarbonTax,탄소세,"탄소세는 기후 변화의 주요 원인으로 생각되는 이산화탄소의 모든 배출에 부과되는 세금이다. 세금은 사실상 공해세이며, 기후 변화에 기여하는 개인과 산업으로 하여금 그들이 초래한 손해에 대한 대가를 치르게 하거나 배출량을 줄이도록 하는 방법이다. 분명히 이 세금은 환경보호론자들에게 인기가 있고, 더 에너지 효율적인 경제로 이어질 수 있습니다."
#,CarEmmissionsLimits,자동차 배출가스 기준,"배기 가스에 대한 법적 제한을 두는 것은 특히 도시에서 공기 오염을 줄이는 데 도움이 되지만, 아직 더 많은 관료주의와 세금으로 간주하는 운전자들에게 인기가 없다."
#,CarTax,자동차세,"모든 자동차의 소유권에 세금을 부과하는 것은 사람들이 대체 교통수단을 이용하도록 설득하는 한 방법이다. 그러나 그러한 제도가 자동차 소유의 고정 비용을 증가시켜 일단 세금을 부과하는 번거로움을 겪으면 사람들이 차를 더 사용하도록 장려한다고 주장할 수 있다. 자동차가 꼭 필요한 농촌의 빈곤층과 주민을 부당하게 때리는 세금이라는 주장도 있다."
#,CCTVCameras,CCTV 카메라,"CCTV 카메라는 범죄자를 잡는 데 큰 도움이 될 수 있고, 카메라 또한 범죄를 예방한다. 설치비가 엄청나게 비싸고, 정부가 계속 지켜보고 있다는 느낌을 받기 싫어하는 사람들의 민권에 대한 우려도 있다."
#,ChildBenefit,아동 수당,"국가가 부모에게 직접 지급하여 양육비를 보조하는 고정 지급. 명백한 이유로 부모들에게 인기가 있고, 이를 재분배세라고 보는 가난한 사람들에게 인기가 있지만 자본가들은 정부의 불필요한 간섭에 반대하고 있다."
#,ChildcareProvision,보육 수당,"육아에 대한 국고보조금을 줌으로써, 우리는 아이를 낳은 후 더 많은 부모들이 노동력에 복귀하도록 할 수 있고, 따라서 경제에 도움이 될 수 있다. 가격이 비쌀 수도 있고, 시장의 왜곡이기도 하지만 학부모들에게 인기가 많다고 말했다."
#,CitizenshipTests,시민권 시험,"시민권 시험은 우리나라로 이주하는 사람들이 우리의 문화와 역사에 대해 입증할 수 있는 이해를 갖도록 하는 방법이다. 이렇게 되면 새로 들어온 사람들이 문화 충돌 가능성을 줄이고 통합을 장려하며 이민을 두려워하지 않아도 되는 사회의 애국적 구성원을 안심시킬 수 있다고 말했다."
#,CleanEnergySubsidies,친환경 에너지 보조금,"재생에너지는 아직 초효율적이지 않을 수 있지만 화석연료 없는 미래를 위해 전략적으로 우리나라에 대비하기 위해 지금 집중적으로 투자하자는 주장이 있다. 환경보호론자들은 명백한 이유로 기뻐하지만 자본가들은 이를 달갑지 않은 에너지 시장의 왜곡으로 보고 있다."
#,CleanFuelSubsidy,친환경 연료 보조금,"모터링의 환경적 영향을 줄이기 위해 초저유황 연료와 같은 청정 연료에 대한 보조금. 보조금은 촉매변환기를 구형 자동차에 장착하는 비용을 줄이고, 펌프에서 덜 손상되는 연료를 선택하도록 인센티브를 제공할 것입니다."
#,CommunityPolicing,지역 경찰제,"지역 사회를 통제하려 하기 보다는 지역 사회와 협력하는 것. 지역 사회 치안 유지 활동은 경찰이 지역 사회의 요구를 더 잘 이해할 수 있도록 격려하는데, 특히 소수 민족이 있는 지역에서 그렇다. 비평가들은 이 돈이 범죄를 줄이기 위한 보다 직접적인 방법에 사용될 수 있는 값비싼 돈 낭비라고 생각합니다."
#,ConsumerRights,소비자 보호제,"최소 수준에서 국가는 소비자가 완전히 바가지를 씌우지 않도록 보장하며, 주파수의 다른 쪽 끝에서 엄격한 법률은 사업을 희생하여 소비자에게 이익을 줄 수 있다. 기업들은 종종 대중 판매를 규제하는 법안의 양에 대해 불평한다."
#,CorporationTax,법인세,"사업 수익에 대한 직접적이고 비례적인 세금. 일부는 이것이 유일한 과세 형태여야 한다고 주장하며, 다른 일부는 그러한 세금이 기업가 정신을 억누르고 사람들이 사업을 시작하는 것을 단념시킨다. 이것은 종종 정부가 돈을 들여오는 주요 방법 중 하나이다."
#,Creationism,교육의 세속화,"과학자들과 자유주의자들은 과학 수업에서 진화에 기초한 증거를 가르쳐야 한다는 것이 명백하다고 생각하는 것에 대해 아이들을 가르치는 방식에 대해 격렬한 논쟁이 벌어졌다. 일부 종교단체들은 진화론이나 '다윈주의'가 증명되지 않은 이론으로 남아 있거나 창조론을 과학의 대안 이론으로 가르쳐야 할 때 사실대로 가르치는 것은 잘못이라고 생각한다. 정부는 우리 학교에서 가르치는 것을 결정해야 합니다."
#,Curfews,야간 통행 금지,"국가 비상사태에 짧은 기간 동안 도입되었다. 이것들은 개인의 자유를 희생하면서 범죄를 퇴치하는 효과적인 방법이 될 수 있다. 그러나 평화로운 시민의 밤 외출 능력을 제한하는 것은 한 나라가 심각한 권위주의로 전락했다는 신호일 수 있다고 말했다."
#,DeathPenalty,사형제,"사형은 심각한 범죄에 대한 궁극적인 처벌이다. 반대론자들은 잘못된 사람을 죽일 가능성에 대해 우려하고 있으며, 오직 야만적인 국가만이 사형제도를 가지고 있다고 제안한다. 지지자들은 그것이 재범하지 않는다는 것을 절대적으로 보장하고, 심각한 범죄를 억제하는 역할을 한다고 지적한다."
#,DetentionWithoutTrial,미결 구금,"재판 없이 구금하면 경찰과 보안 기관은 피의자에게 유죄를 선고할 충분한 증거가 없을 때(또는 민감한 증거를 밝힐 수 없을 때) 피의자를 구금할 수 있습니다. 이는 테러 방지라는 명분으로 정당화될 수 있지만 자유주의자들은 이것이 인권을 침해하는 것이라고 우려했다."
#,DisabilityBenefit,장애 수당,"장애인이 일을 할 수 없거나 도움이 필요하다는 사실을 인정하기 위해 국가에서 장애인에게 직접 지급합니다. 게다가 많은 장애인들은 교통이나 주거 면에서 특별한 요건을 가지고 있습니다."
#,FaithSchoolSubsidies,종교 학교 보조금,"종교 학교는 좋은 학업 수준을 달성할 수 있다. 그들의 지지자들은 정부가 효과적이라고 입증된 교육 방법에 보조금을 지급해야 한다고 주장합니다. 비판론자들은 종교는 교육에서 설 자리가 없고 정부가 아이들에게 특정 종교를 '밀어붙이는' 모습을 보일 수 없다고 말한다."
#,ForeignAid,대외 원조,"일부 외국은 매우 가난한 경제, 교육 또는 식량 부족을 가지고 있으며, 우리처럼 상대적으로 부유한 나라들은 그들을 도와야 할 도덕적 의무가 있다고 주장할 수 있다. 다른 사람들은 어떤 나라의 우선 순위도 자국민에게 있다고 주장할 수 있고, 만약 그 시민들이 돕고 싶다면, 그들은 자선단체를 통해 개별적으로 그렇게 할 수 있다."
#,FreeBusPasses,노년층 무임승차제,"전통적으로, 무임승차제는 은퇴 연령의 시민들에게 양보로 제공된다. 이것은 비용이 많이 들 수 있지만, 자동차 사용을 줄이고 따라서 오염과 교통 혼잡을 줄일 수 있는 좋은 방법입니다. 그러나 일각에서는 이 같은 시장 왜곡에 반대하고 있다."
#,FreeEyeTests,무료 시력검사,"시력 검사는 초기에 문제를 발견하고 시력이 나쁜 사람들에게 안경이 필요하다고 조언한다. 개인적으로 시력 검사를 받는 것은 비용이 많이 들 수 있고, 많은 사람들이 필요 없이 하는 것은 사치입니다. 사회학자들은 무료 시력검사를 보편적으로 제공하는 것이 모두에게 '안전망'을 제공하는 데 필수적이라고 생각한다."
#,FreeSchoolMeals,무상 급식,"무상급식은 모든 사람이 그들의 아이들을 먹일 수 있도록 함으로써 부를 재분배하는 방법일 뿐만 아니라, 아이들이 순전히 정크 푸드로 살아남기 보다는 건강하게 먹도록 하는 방법이다."
#,Gambling,도박 합법화,"어떤 사람들에게는, 도박은 가난과 재앙을 초래하는 죄이지만, 다른 사람들은 일부 '사회적' 도박은 무해한 재미라고 믿고 있는데, 이것은 정부가 추가적인 수입의 형태로 세금을 부과할 수도 있다. 그것은 또한 관광업을 장려하고 일자리를 창출한다."
#,GatedCommunities,출입통제형 주거단지,"심각한 길거리 범죄와 반달리즘에 대한 과감한 해결책인, 게이트 커뮤니티는 기본적으로 자율적인 주택가이다. 그들은 부유한 사람들에게 인기가 있지만, 종종 계급의 분열과 불평등과 관련이 있다. 왜냐하면 상대적으로 부유한 사람들만이 그들 안에서 살 여유가 있기 때문이다. 이에 따라 일부 정부는 건설 허가를 꺼리고 있다."
#,GraduateTax,학위세,"학위세는 대학 등록금에 기여하는 방법으로서, 순수하게 대학을 졸업하는 사람들에게 부과되는 전용 세금이다. 지지자들은 이것이 공평하다고 말한다. 왜냐하면 모든 사람들이 대학교육으로부터 혜택을 받는 것은 아니기 때문이다. 반대론자들은 순수한 학문적 주제와 예술을 공부하는 것은 욕망에 불이익을 줄 뿐만 아니라 나쁜 동기를 유발한다고 주장한다."
#,HandgunLaws,총기관리법,"어떤 나라들은 사실상 어떤 종류의 화기의 무제한 소유권을 허용하는 반면, 다른 나라에서는 엄격히 통제된다. 어떤 사람들은 자신을 방어할 수 있는 기본권을 얘기하고, 어떤 사람들은 총기 소유가 총기 범죄로 이어진다고 우려한다."
#,HybridCarsInitiative,하이브리드 자동차 보조금,"하이브리드 자동차는 더 느린 속도에서는 이산화탄소가 발생하지 않는 전기 엔진을 사용하기 때문에 환경에 덜 해롭다. 그들은 또한 더 높은 연비를 얻어서 석유 수요를 줄인다. 단점은 가격이 매우 비싸지만 세금 혜택으로 인해 더 많은 사람들이 새 차를 구입할 때 하이브리드 모델을 구입하도록 장려할 수 있다는 것이다."
#,IDCards,신분증,"일각에서는 신분증이 테러 등 중범죄에 대한 강력한 억지력으로 작용한다고 주장하지만 진보주의자들은 국가가 시민에게 즉석에서 신원을 밝히라고 요구하는 것은 개인의 시민적 자유를 침해하는 것이라고 주장할 것이다."
#,ImportTarrifs,관세,"싼 수입품은 국내 기업들이 외국 경쟁사들이 지불하는 낮은 임금에 견줄 수 없기 때문에 경제에 해를 끼칠 수 있다. 수입 관세는 국내 제조업체들을 '불공정'한 경쟁으로부터 보호하는 데 도움이 된다. 그러나 이는 실제 자유시장경제와는 배치되는 것으로 외국에는 불공정하다고 볼 수 있어 보복의 불씨가 될 수 있다고 말했다."
#,IncomeTax,소득세,"정부의 자금을 조달하는 가장 인기 있는 방법 중 하나는 국민 소득에 대한 직접 세금으로 그들의 고용주가 원천적으로 공제하는 것이다. 소득세는 일반적으로 누진세(부자가 빈곤층보다 소득의 일부분으로 더 많이 낸다)로 사회주의자, 저임금층에게 인기가 높다."
#,FlatTax,고정소득세,"고정소득세는 국민 모두가 총소득에 관계없이 소득세의 한계율을 똑같이 내는 세금이다. 이에 따라 CEO의 총세금 고지서가 더 높아지겠지만, 사무실 청소원은 CEO와 같은 요율을 부담한다. 이 간단한 구조는 회피와 회피로 이어질 수 있다. 진보적이지 않고, 소득 불평등을 심화시킬 수 있습니다."
#,CapitalGainsTax,양도소득세,"양도소득세는 주식시장 이익과 주식배당 등 비급여 소득과 재산이나 기타 자산을 매각해 얻은 이익에 대해 부과하는 세금이다. 주로 그것은 부유층과 기업 소유주들에게 영향을 미치며, 경제가 호황일 경우 더 많은 돈을 모을 것이다. 투자에 따른 이익에 세금을 부과하기 때문에 투자에 대한 약간의 억지력으로 작용해 경제에 해롭다.
#,InheritanceTax,상속세,"개인의 재산이 후손에게 물려질 때 내는 세금. 상속세는 가계가 세대에 비해 부와 이점을 누리는 것을 방지하여 평등을 보호하므로 사회주의자와 가난한 사람들에게 인기가 있다. 하지만, 어떤 사람들은 힘들게 번 재산, 특히 그들의 집을 자녀들에게 물려주는 것을 막는 어떤 일에도 강하게 반대한다."
#,IntelligenceServices,정보 기관,"보안 서비스는 조직적인 범죄와 테러와의 싸움에서 필수적인 도구이다. 훌륭하고 신뢰할 수 있는 지능은 얻기 어렵고 비용이 많이 들 수 있으며, 많은 경우 채택된 방법은 진보주의자와 인권 옹호자들에게 인기가 없을 수 있다."
#,InternetCensorship,인터넷 검열,"자유주의자들은 인터넷의 가장 큰 특징은 검열과 통제로부터 자유로워지고 개방적이고 관대한 사회로 이어진다고 제안할 것이다. 그러나 자유에는 그 대가가 있고, 인터넷에는 범죄 의도를 가진 사람들을 도울 수 있는 자료가 부족하지 않다. 웹상에서 검열해야 할 것과 해서는 안 될 것에 대한 의견이 심하게 갈린다."
#,InternetTax,인터넷세,"점점 더 많은 상거래가 기존의 '오프라인' 사업장에서 웹으로 이동함에 따라, 정부는 '경기장 평준화'를 위해 그러한 거래에 세금을 부과하려는 유혹을 받고 있다. 하지만, 인터넷 세금에 반대하는 사람들은 그러한 조치가 첨단 기술 경제를 약화시키고 국가의 경쟁력에 막대한 해를 끼칠 것이라고 주장합니다."
#,JuryTrial,배심원 제도,"법관이 아닌 일반 대중이 재판할 수 있는 권리는 많은 진보주의자들에 의해 기본적인 인권으로 여겨진다. 보수주의자들은 그러한 과정이 비용이 많이 들고 시간 낭비이며 판사나 치안판사 그룹보다 공평하지 않다고 주장한다. 경미한 재판은 치안판사가 주재하는 등 중범죄에 대한 배심재판이 유보되는 시스템을 갖출 수 있다고 말했다."
#,LabourLaws,노동법,"노동법은 기본적으로 노동자의 파업권에 대한 제한이다. 자본가들은 이러한 규제가 발전소 직원, 경찰, 기관사와 같은 주요 근로자들이 국가를 몸값으로 붙잡아 두는 것을 막기 위해 필수적이라고 주장한다. 노조원들은 파업권이 기본이고 협상에 열려 있지 않다고 말했다."
#,LegalAid,법률 구조 제도,"모든 사람이 법정에서 변호하기 위해 변호사에게 돈을 지불할 수 있는 것은 아니다. 비록 시민은 이론적으로는 자신을 변호할 수 있지만, 국영 변호사를 제공하는 것은 더 공정한 제도를 만들어야 한다. 반면에, 이것은 기본적으로 이미 범죄 혐의로 기소되었지만 유죄가 입증될 때까지 무죄임을 기억하는 사람들에게 큰 보조금입니다."
#,LegaliseProstitution,성매매 합법화,"보수주의자들은 매춘 합법화가 가족 가치의 심각한 하락을 나타낼 것이라고 주장한다. 매춘이 사라질 것 같지 않은 만큼 불법이라 하더라도 사회와 성노동자가 범죄화되기보다는 관행을 규제하고 감시하는 게 낫다는 주장도 있다."
#,LuxuryGoodsTax,사치세,"우리 사회의 고소비자들을 겨냥한 세금. 스포츠카, 개인 요트 등 고부가가치 사치품에 할증료가 붙는다. 비록 그것이 결코 방대한 수입원은 아니지만, 사치품세는 빈부격차에 대해 우려하는 사람들에게 인기가 있을 수 있다. 사치품세는 고소득자들이 다른 곳에서 생활하고 일하도록 장려할 수 있다."
#,MarriedTaxAllowance,기혼자 세액공제,"이것은 결혼한 부부들에게 세금 감면이며, 사람들이 결혼하고 함께 지내도록 격려하는 것으로 주어진다. 교회 단체들은 국가가 전통적인 가족 가치를 장려하는 것이 필수적이라고 본다. 종교가 아무런 이유 없이 세금에 간섭하는 것으로 보는 시각도 있다고 말했다."
#,MaternityLeave,출산 휴가,"어떤 사람들에게는, 산모들에게 출산 휴가와 그 후 직장에 복귀할 권리가 있다는 것은 문명화된 사회의 표시이며, 여성들이 일을 하도록 장려하는 신호이다. 일부 중소기업은 특히 직원 수가 적은 곳에서는 예측 불가능하고 잠재적으로 심각한 부담을 고용주에게 지우는 것을 우려하고 있다. 이는 실제로 고용주들이 여성을 고용하지 않도록 부추긴다고 주장할 수 있다."
#,MicrogenerationGrants,자가 전력 보조금,"이러한 보조금은 태양 전지판과 풍력 터빈과 같은 에너지 마이크로 발전 시스템의 비용을 보조하기 위해 시민들에게 주어진다. 이는 더 깨끗하고 친환경적인 에너지로 개인적인 발걸음을 내딛고자 하는 일부 사람들의 욕구를 활용할 수 있는 좋은 방법이며 국가 전체의 에너지 효율을 높일 수 있을 것이라고 말했다."
#,MilitarySpending,국방비,"현대적이고 장비를 잘 갖춘 군대는 엄청난 재산을 들일 수 있고 많은 사람들은 그 돈이 다른 곳에서 가장 잘 사용될 수 있다고 생각한다. 다른 사람들(특히 애국자)은 자유와 안보를 위해 대가를 치를 수 없다고 주장할 것이고, 또한 우리의 기업, 기술, 고용 수치에도 막대한 이익을 지적할 것이다."
#,Monorail,고속 철도 보조금,"이것은 보통 속도로 질주하는 표준 철도망이 아니라, 나라를 연결하고 주요 도시들 간에 초고속 이동을 허용하는, 21세기에 적합한 현대적인 첨단 철도 체계이다. 비용은 높지만 통근자, 경제 및 환경에 대한 혜택은 명확합니다."
#,MortgageTaxRelief,주택담보대출 소득공제,"이것은 사람들이 집을 사기 위해 돈을 빌릴 때 내야 하는 이자 지불에 대해 세금 감면 혜택을 요구할 수 있게 한다. 이는 주택 구입자의 주택담보대출 상환 여력에 도움을 주지만 사실상 주택 구입자에 대한 세금 감면 혜택이기 때문에 집을 살 처지가 아닌 사람들이 분개할 수 있다."
#,Narcotics,마약류관리법,"대마초와 헤로인과 같은 약물이 합법화되어야 하는가? 합법화를 주장하는 이들은 문제는 마약 밀거래와 관련된 범죄이기 때문에, 마약 합법화가 이로 인한 범죄를 줄일 수 있으리라고 주장한다. 반면 마약 반대자들은 마약으로 인한 건강 상의 위험성을 지적하고, 마약이 범죄자들에게 주어질 수 있음을 지적하고 있다.."
#,NationalService,징병제,"자국을 외부의 공격으로부터 방어하는 기초 훈련을 받은 일부 시민들에 대한 징병제는 몇몇 이점이 있다. 그 예로 징병제를 통해 지금보다 더 적은 규모의 정규군을 갖출 수 있게 된다는 것이다. 그러나 징병제는 그들의 의지와는 무관하게 무기를 들도록 강요한다는 것에 대한 우려가 있다."
#,OrganDonation,장기 기증,"장기 이식이 놀라운 기술임을 부정하는 이는 없지만, 많은 기증자를 필요로 하고 있다. 안타깝게도 많은 사람들은 이 주제를 고려하지 않는다. 때문에 일각에서는 명시되지 않은 한, 장기 기증에 동의한 것으로 간주하는 '옵트아웃(무관여)' 정책이 최선이라고 주장한다. 반면 장기 기증은 국가가 관여할 사항이 아니며, 분명한 동의 의사에 따라 장기 기증이 이루어져야 한다는 주장도 있다."
#,OrganicSubsidy,유기농업 지원금,"유기농업을 지지하는 이들은 인공적인 향료와 첨가제가 없는 식품의 건강상 이점으로 유기농업을 국가가 보조해야 한다고 주장한다. 이는 자연히 농부들과 환경론자들에게 인기가 있으나, 일각에서는 자유 시장에 대한 무의미한 왜곡으로 보고 있다."
#,PetrolTax,유류세,"Taxing fuel can be a huge source of income for a government, and can also be seen as a 'green' policy by encouraging people to drive less, or to use more fuel efficient cars. Critics suggest that this is just another cynical tax on the motorist, and some complain that the alternative (public transport) is not a viable option for everyone."
#,PhoneTapping,감청,"From a law and order perspective, wire tapping is an essential weapon in the fight against organized crime and terrorism. The problem is that it's difficult to prevent misuse of such a system, and liberals are keen to point out how widespread wire tapping is a very sinister sign of a police state."
#,PlasticBagTax,비닐봉투세,"Plastic bags, unlike paper ones are not biodegradable so can last more or less forever, eventually ending up in huge unsightly landfill sites. A tax on bags discourages their use and encourages people to re-use stronger, more environmentally friendly alternatives. Capitalists just see this as the state meddling."
#,PoliceForce,경찰,"Every government needs to employ a police force to ensure order is kept and laws are obeyed, but it's a matter of debate exactly how much should be spent on the police. Some favor a large force with police on every street corner, other prefer a more low-key and tolerant approach."
#,PollutionControls,공해방지법,"Restrictions on what chemicals and emissions can be released into the atmosphere. Controls reduce pollution and increase health, possibly at the cost of economic competitiveness."
#,PrisonerTagging,전자발찌,"A high tech alternative to incarceration that allows people to re-integrate with the community upon release from prison, whilst allowing law enforcement authorities to keep a close eye on them. Liberals have concerns that such a system is a step towards a police state which monitors our every move."
#,Prisons,교도소,"Some argue that providing the minimum number of bare, cold cells is the only provision that needs to be made for those who have broken the law. Others suggest that spending more money allows for prisoners to be rehabilitated as well as punished and reduces the chances of reoffending."
#,PropertyTax,재산세,"Property tax is a tax levied on the value of homes. The valuation is often made by a government body, and the money is used to fund local government services (at least in part) such as the provision of street lighting and emergency services. Some see it as a fair tax which mostly affects those who own large homes and are wealthy, others see it as an unfair tax on retired people with large homes but little actual income."
#,PublicLibraries,공공도서관,"Public libraries provide a number of services, acting as a focus for communities, providing access to information and literature to those on low incomes, and enabling people to learn new skills outside the normal educational establishment."
#,RacialProfiling,인종기반 수사기법,"Racial (or ethnic) profiling is the practice of using race as a factor in identifying criminals and potential criminals. Law enforcement officials claim that using racial profiling allows them to quickly narrow down lists of potential suspects, and to best concentrate their efforts but opponents fear that it leads to racial discrimination by the police."
#,RaceDiscriminationAct,인종차별금지법,"Prevents citizens being discriminated against purely on the basis of race, i.e. racist employment practices etc."
#,Recycling,재활용,"Supporters of recycling argue that dumping waste in landfills just isn't a long term solution, and the government needs to show the way by providing facilities to recycle as many waste materials as possible. This might include recycling newspapers, cardboard, bottles and even some plastics."
#,RoadBuilding,도로건설,"Although environmentalists often argue that more roads just lead to more congestion, not surprisingly this isn't how the motorist who is sat in traffic sees it. Building new roads is a very expensive and very slow process, but some suggest its vital to keep our economy functioning."
#,RuralDevelopmentGrants,농촌개발지원금,"As technology advances and more and more citizens take jobs in our cities, there is a danger that poverty and unemployment will rise to unacceptable levels in the countryside. Rural development grants do distort the free market, but they also support rural businesses and prevent poverty amongst farmers and other rural occupations."
#,SalesTax,부가가치세,"Sales tax is the classic 'regressive' tax, which means it does not take into account the ability to pay. Critics argue that this affects the poor disproportionately and thus increases inequality. Supporters argue that it is relatively easy to collect and affects everyone, and is thus fair. Businesses can be opposed to the administrative burden of the tax."
#,SateliteRoadPricing,위성위치측정식 통행요금체계,An expensive system that requires transponders to be fitted to everyone's car and keeps track of what roads people use (and when). Allows per-road pricing for car usage which gives local authorities fine control over reducing congestion without burdening motorists in more remote rural areas who have no alternative transport system.
#,SchoolBuses,통학버스 보조금,"State subsidies for school buses ensure that every school kid has an efficient, and safe journey to school, whilst reducing the number of short 'school-run' trips carried out by parents, thus reducing traffic on the roads. Parents are also happier knowing that there are proper approved school buses."
#,SchoolPrayers,교내 예배,"Liberals will often argue that the education of our younger citizens should be kept entirely separate from any religious teachings. On the other hand, it's argued that some compulsory prayer in schools is a way of promoting moral values in our children."
#,ScienceFunding,과학기금,"In some countries, the majority of research is funded by private companies. State-sponsored science can be useful for investing in very long-term research projects or those that may not be commercially rewarding. The benefits of state sector research are freely available to the entire population, rather than patented by corporations."
#,SmallBusinessGrants,중소기업 지원금,"The failure rate for small businesses is very high. In the early years of trading, a preferential government grant can be an enormous help to get a new enterprise off the ground. This can lead to a big boost to the economy, but it can also be an expensive policy with no guarantee of good results."
#,SpaceProgram,우주 개발 프로그램,"Invest in your country's efforts to explore space! As well as the purely scientific benefits, a well-funded space program will boost the level of technological expertise throughout the entire economy. It will also unite the country and encourage patriotism."
#,SpeedCameras,과속카메라,"Speed cameras are an automated way to enforce speed restrictions on our roads, without having to invest a fortune in extra traffic police. Supporters claim they reduce road deaths and free up the police to deal with more serious crime, opponents claim they are a cynical way of taxing the motorist and have nothing to do with safety"
#,StateHealthService,공공의료보험,"Although many citizens would be happy to pay privately for their own health treatment, there is an argument that the state has a duty to provide a minimum level of free health treatment for everyone regardless of income. Health provision can be expensive, so it's a matter of debate as to how much should be spent."
#,StateHousing,공공주택,"Some citizens prefer to own their own homes, but the cost of housing is such that a large proportion of the population live in rented accommodation. State housing is provided, at a reduced rate, to those who cannot afford to pay the market rate. This can be expensive to fund, but the social benefits are also significant."
#,StatePensions,공적연금,"Rather than leave it up to the individual to provide for themselves after retirement, state pensions can guarantee a minimum standard of living for the elderly. Be aware that as life expectancy rises, the cost to the state of paying out pensions increases hugely. The level of state pension may encourage or discourage citizens to save into private pension plans."
#,StateSchools,공립학교,"Free education for all ensures high levels of literacy and can be beneficial to the economy, especially those parts of the economy requiring a skilled workforce. The flipside of this is that state education can be expensive for the government. Capitalists see state education as an unnecessary intervention in the free market."
#,StemCells,줄기세포 연구,"A stem cell is a primitive type of cell that can be developed into most of the types of cells found in the human body. Some scientists claim that stem cell research offers great hope for curing diseases such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis. However, because stem cells are taken from discarded human embryos, many 'pro-life' and religious groups oppose their usage."
#,TaxShelters,조세 피난처,"By not fully taxing the wealth of the super-rich, tax shelters can be a great way to encourage successful entrepreneurs to make our country their home. With an ever-shrinking world, the rich are free to settle wherever they please. encouraging them to live here may mean that they spend their wealth in this country. Such measures can be very unpopular with the poor, who resent paying tax on their much lower earnings."
#,TechnologyColleges,기술 대학,"Technology colleges are 'specialist schools' with a focus on computer literacy, biotechnology and similar subjects. These state-run colleges receive special funding from central government in order to encourage a greater level of technological literacy amongst the future workforce."
#,TechnologyGrants,기술개발 지원금,"The government can provide state funding to encourage business to invest in new and exciting technologies. Although this helps give us a competitive advantage and can create jobs, it can be argued that its an unnecessary distortion of the market."
#,TelecommutingInitiative,재택근무 추진계획,"Telecommuting, or 'working from home' is seen as desirable because it reduces the pressure on the transport infrastructure, and can be an improvement to people's quality of life. It's also welcomed by parents. This policy offers tax incentives to companies supporting this option."
#,TobaccoTax,담배세,"Despite the failure of tobacco companies to admit it, there is good reason to believe that smoking has negative effects on health. This is used as a justification for taxing tobacco. Cynics point out that the government benefits hugely from a tax on a product it is supposedly against. Health campaigners encourage the tax as a way to encourage a more healthy population"
#,TollRoads,도로통행료,"Toll roads charge motorists to use specific roads (normally major highways). This is a great example of directly applying market forces, by only charging those who use a particular route for the construction and maintenance of that route. Motorists tend to see this as just another form of taxation, whereas commuters appreciate not being charged for roads they seldom use."
#,UnemployedBenefit,실업급여,Unemployment benefit is a state benefit given to everyone who is able to work but cannot find employment. Socialists regard this as a minimum safety net for workers out of work because of the whims of the economy. Some believe that high unemployment benefits distort the market and discourage people from seeking work.
#,UniversityGrants,대학 지원금,"Although not all citizens will pursue a university education, governments can provide subsidies to students to encourage a more educated workforce. University grants also ensure equality of opportunity, as in their absence the cost of a university education can be beyond the reach of working class families."
#,WelfareFraudDept,복지 부정수급 조사부,"When government gives so much money out in welfare payments, it's essential that the money is correctly targeted and not exploited by people making spurious claims. A dedicated fraud department will detect false claimants, recover lost money and reassure middle income tax payers that their taxes are being spent wisely, although it can antagonize legitimate claimants."
#,WinterFuelSubsidy,난방비 보조금,A special concession given to the elderly. This is a regular welfare payment made to everyone over retirement age towards the cost of their winter fuel bills. It is designed to reduce 'fuel poverty' which can occur when some elderly members of society cannot afford to heat their homes in winter.
#,WorkSafetyLaw,산업안전법,"Work safety law, often known as 'health and safety' is a series of measures to ensure employees are not at risk from injury in their day-to-day activities. Trade unionists often hail such laws as a valuable defense against unscrupulous employers who may put lives at risk. Many business leaders are concerned at the high levels of bureaucracy and restrictive practices that can result from such laws, which they see as a burden on business."
#,YouthClubSubsidies,청소년센터 보조금,"Free youth clubs ensure that teenagers have a 'place to go' which can help them to stay out of trouble, and in the long run, reduce the incidence of street crime. It can be resented by some wealthier taxpayers, who see it as an unnecessary expense, paid for by their taxes."
#,AbortionLaw,낙태법,"Few areas of policy incite stronger emotions that the debate over abortion. On the 'pro-life' side, are arguments about the rights of the unborn child, and arguments are often made from a  religious standpoint. On the 'pro-choice' side, there is the argument that the State should not have more say over what a woman does with her body than she does. Making any change to the States position on abortion requires a hefty amount of political capital."
#,RentControls,임대료 규제,"An alternative to state-housing is a system where the state will regulate the private-rental market in a bid to ensure the supply of affordable housing for all, even within the private sector. Capitalists will naturally see this as a distortion of the free market that will prevent enough homes being built, whereas supporters will say it prevents exploitation of the poor by greedy landlords."
#,SchoolVouchers,교육 바우처,"A measure designed to encourage the growth of private schooling, whilst still enabling everyone to afford an education. School  vouchers are issued by the state to parents for each child which they can then spend in the private sector on education. This is a different approach to pure state schooling because with school vouchers the schools are privately run and the teachers are no longer state employees."
#,OilDrillingSubsidy,석유 시추 보조금,"To encourage investment in new oil and gas drilling, and thus raise the supply of fossil fuel energy for the country, these tax breaks effectively subsidize fossil fuels. This will indirectly reduce fuel prices and stimulate the economy, but will be an outrage to environmentalists."
#,MansionTax,고급주택 보유세,"A special high rate of tax charged annually on the ownership of super-expensive homes. This tax is popular with some because it is almost impossible to avoid, as homes cannot be easily hidden. It is perceived as unfair by some elderly people who may have expensive homes but relatively low incomes, and thus have difficulty in paying the annual tax. It is a form of wealth-tax, as opposed to income tax."
#,FuelEfficiency,자동차 연비 규제,"Mandatory standards for new cars which dictate the minimum level of fuel efficiency. This is a long term measure aimed to raise the fuel efficiency of the country's cars, and thus reduce our dependence on oil, as well as reducing the cost of driving over the long term. It will be unpopular with car manufacturers, but a hit with environmentalists."
#,ForeignInvestorTaxBreaks,외국인투자 조세감면,"Special tax breaks given to large foreign-owned multinational companies to encourage them to invest in our country. This could include tax-free periods, introductory rates of corporate tax, and straight subsidies to encourage investment. Helps to encourage investment from overseas, but will be seen as incredibly unpatriotic, and pandering to the whims of huge foreign capitalist organizations."
#,RoboticsResearch,로봇 연구지원금,"A special grant to encourage research in robotics. Robotics is a very long term area of research which will eventually bring about vast boosts in productivity, but at the same time it will reduce the amount of low or semi-skilled jobs in the economy, and thus potentially lead to higher unemployment."
#,PrivatePrisons,민영 교도소,"Rather than directly control and manage a State prison service, this policy allows prisons to be privately owned and managed, and merely paid for by the state. Private prisons could result in lower cost and higher efficiency. These measures will be unpopular with trade unionists. Liberals will have ethical concerns about profiting from incarceration, but still be pleased if spending is high enough to promote rehabilitation."
#,JunkFoodTax,정크푸드세,"A punitive tax rate charged on unhealthy food such as takeaway hamburgers, fizzy drinks and high sugar or fat content pre-processed food. Levied with the aim of improving the health of the nation, but can be unpopular."
#,HealthFoodSubsidies,건강식품 보조금,"A tax incentive that makes healthy food, such as fruit and vegetables, cheaper than the higher fat or higher sugar foods. Seen as an incentive to eat well, rather than a punishment for eating badly, and thus less punitive on the poor than a 'fat tax'."
#,Tasers,테이저건,A non-lethal but still highly effective (and possibly dangerous) weapon which effectively gives criminals an electric shock. Supporters say it is a good compromise between the need to disable violent criminals and the risk of death associated with traditional firearms. Opponents claim that the use of such weapons lowers the barrier-to-use for the police and will encourage more casual use of force against the population.
#,PoliceDrones,경찰 드론,"Unmanned aerial reconnaissance vehicles, similar to remote control planes which can be employed by the police force. The 'eye in the sky' is a useful way to keep track of mobs and rioters, and allows for subtle yet effective surveillance. The police see it as a vital tool for modern crime fighting, but there are concerns that this is a step further towards a big-brother style surveillance society where everyone is tracked."
#,ArtsSubsidies,예술 보조금,"Investing public money in the arts is controversial with capitalists who see it as supporting uneconomic elitist entertainment, but others see it as vital to a countries culture, boosting our image on the world stage, and attracting tourists."
#,HealthcareVouchers,의료 바우처,"A measure designed to encourage the growth of private health care whilst still enabling everyone access to it. Healthcare vouchers are  issued by the state to everyone but can then only be spent in the private sector on health care. This is a different approach to pure state health care because with healthcare vouchers, the hospitals are privately run and the medical staff are no longer state employees."
#,HealthTaxCredits,의료비 세액공제,"A system of tax-reductions and credits designed to encourage people to spend their money on private healthcare, in order to reduce their tax liability. This boosts healthcare without involving the state running hospitals or employing doctors, but it's effect is limited to those people in society earning enough to be paying tax in the first place."
#,SchoolTaxCredits,교육비 세액공제,A system of tax-reductions and credits designed to encourage people to spend their money on private education in order to reduce their tax liability. This boosts private schooling without involving the State running schools or employing teachers but it's effect is limited to those people in society earning enough to be paying tax in the first place.
#,FoodStamps,푸드 스탬프,"Food stamps is a system where the state will issue vouchers or 'stamps' to those citizens on low or no income, to ensure they are able to afford food. Unlike giving a straight cash benefit, food stamps can only be redeemed for uncooked food, preventing them being used for unhealthy takeaway food. Supporters see food stamps as a valuable way to ensure nobody goes hungry, no matter their income. Critics consider such a scheme patronizing, and no more than papering over the cracks caused by free market failure and low wages."
#,FoodStandards,식품안전국,"A food standards agency is a branch of government dedicated to ensuring the safety and minimum nutritional standards of food supplied within the country. Farmers may regard the agency as an extra layer of bureaucracy and meddling, but public health campaigners see the agency as an essential line of defense between the consumer and unscrupulous food producers looking to cut costs."
#,EnterpriseInvestmentScheme,기업투자제도,"The Enterprise Investment Scheme is a system which gives tax breaks to wealthy individuals who invest their money in small startup companies which are based in this country. The scheme encourages investment in companies which should eventually grow and stimulate the economy, whilst at the same time giving a popular tax break to people who invest in them. Obviously indirectly, the scheme is being subsidized by those without savings to invest."
#,RecreationalDrugsTax,오락성 약물세,"In societies that have legalized drugs such as Cannabis and Psychedelics there is a temptation to treat consumption of these drugs as a source of government revenue, given the claims that their consumption should be politely discouraged due to the negative effects on citizens health, in a similar way to governments taxing alcohol or tobacco."
#,HumanCloningResearchGrants,인간복제 연구지원금,"Stem cell research was just the first step. Human cloning is around the corner and our country can be on the forefront of this groundbreaking development. The religious are enraged, but rich prospective parents hope to make the dream of replicating themselves true."
#,DroneStrikeAct,드론공습법,Global terrorism threatens our country. Drone strikes on foreign grounds are a safe way to prevent terror organisations from reaching their full potential. Patriots are calling for surgical strikes on terror leaders while liberals regard those as unethical.
#,ElectricCarsInitiative,전기차 지원계획,The introduction of a standardized nation-wide recharging system for electric cars has lead to increased sales of such vehicles. Encouraging the acquisition of electric cars reduces our countries dependence on oil. Environmentalists are happy about every car that does not emit carbon dioxide.
#,ClimateChangeAdaptionFund,기후변화적응기금,"Global warming has lead to increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. The Climate Change Adaption Fund finances large-scale projects from dams to weather satellites, from reforesting to water reservoirs. It might be expensive, but environmentalists and farmers call for this policy."
#,OneChildPolicy,한 자녀 정책,A one-child policy is a measure of population control to keep overpopulation and related economic and social problems at bay. It reduces poverty and stabilizes the fertility rate. Parents and religious people oppose the law.
#,MarsProgram,화성 프로그램,"Tabloids have been speaking of a new space age for a while. It is time to reach for the stars! Why not start with the neighbor planet Mars? The Mars Program yields new technological innovations, unites the country, and makes patriots proud."
#,AntibioticsBan,항생제사료 금지,"Ranchers and farmers have been feeding antibiotics to livestock since they discovered decades ago that small doses of antibiotics administered daily make most animals gain additional weight. Although conclusive evidence directly linking the use of drugs in food animals to an increase in drug-resistant bacteria has not been uncovered, a number of recent studies suggesting such a link concern many scientists. Banning antibiotics leads to decreased meat production but ensures consumer safety."
#,MandatoryMicrochipImplant,마이크로칩 의무이식,"Passports can be forged and fingerprints can be faked. A microchip under the skin makes every individual in this country technically recognizable. Once implemented, law enforcement will be able to track exactly who went where when. Liberals are enraged about the possibility of absolute surveillance."
#,RareEarthRefinement,희토류 채굴,Support national initiatives for rare earth metal mining in order to make the country's industrial and high tech production less dependent on imports from foreign countries. The extraction process is not good for the environment but our technological advancement depends on rare earth metals. Environmentalists are furious.
#,DriverlessCarLaws,자율주행 법안,Driverless car technology is booming. The manufacturers are encouraging the government to allow their use on public roads.
#,SyntheticMeatResearchGrants,인공배양육 연구지원금,"Overfarming, droughts and population growth result in increases in meat prices. Synthetic production can make meat affordable for the masses. Farmers are opposed, as food production moves from the field to the lab."
#,InternetCurrencyTaxation,암호화폐 과세,"More and more commerce is handled in cryptocurrencies. To cover the cost of tax evasion and tie the new currencies to the fiscal system, rules and taxation are required. An internet currency tax reduces the income of everyone trading in cryptocurrencies, mostly self-employed and small companies."
#,VerticalFarmSubsidies,수직농업 보조금,Farmland is getting rare but recent inventions in architecture and agriculture could easily be bundled to make vertical farming in cities feasible. Food production in vertical farms requires more resources but reduced transport costs mitigate that problem.
#,GreenElectronicsInitiative,친환경 전자제품 정책계획,"The goal of the Green Electronics Initiative is to reduce electronic waste. From cleaner mining operations to upcycling projects, a broad array of measures should make the digital world a cleaner place."
#,InternationalFusionResearchProject,국제 핵융합 연구 프로젝트,"Participate in an international nuclear fusion research and engineering project with the goal of creating a commercially viable fusion power plant. Nuclear fusion is safer and more efficient than fission. While expensive, this research will contribute to technological development and energy efficiency. Environmentalists are traditionally wary of atomic energy."
#,LimitAutomatedTrading,자동매매 제한,"Automated stock market trading software exploits minute movements and short-term patterns in the markets, yielding to higher volatility and instability. Stock market crashes can be prevented by limiting the abilities of automated trading. Capitalists and the wealthy profit most from automated trading."
#,AutomationTax,자동화세,"Technological innovation has led to brilliant inventions. The dark side of industrial automation is that it is leading to job loss. Less jobs mean less income tax. To make up for the loss in state income, the economy ministry has designed an automation tax, to be paid by the most advanced companies."
#,GovernmentSubsidiesForUnions,노동조합 정부보조금,"Trade unions provide a vital service to our nation, and it is in the collective interests of the people that they be encouraged and supported throughout all industries and workplaces. Therefore the government should provide funding, from taxation to support their activities."
#,SecretCourts,비공개 재판,"To combat modern terrorism and crime, it is sometimes necessary to keep things from the public. For that, secret courts are established and controlled by government officials to assure that the law is followed and not broken. We cannot effectively fight terrorism and serious crime if our secret services methods get exposed in open courts."
#,GeneralMediaCensorship,일반매체검열,"There are times when an outraged public is counterproductive to the well-being of a democracy. Enabling  general media censorship can prevent bad rumors and speculation from spiraling out of control and while it limits civil rights, less violence and fear might be worth the effort. We do not wish to give antisocial extremists the free use of our media to create unrest."
#,TortureUsageBySecretServices,정보기관의 고문 허용,"Terrorists are tough customers and to prevent some attacks, extraordinary measures sometimes have to be deployed. While it is never 100% clear how much crime and terrorism can be reduced by such a policy, surely it makes sense to not fight such enemies with one hand tied behind the back of our security services? You have to fight fire with fire."
#,CapCEOPayMultiplier,최고경영자 임금상한제,"Nobody disputes that the job of CEO of a large company is hard, but the current level of pay for executives is out of control and is causing huge anger among the lower paid. A cap on CEO pay is entirely reasonable in a just and fair society."
#,BanSecondHomeOwnership,다주택 보유 금지,"The laws of physics dictate that a person can only be in one place at once. So why would people have the need for two homes? With this policy, owning more than one house is outlawed and empty property will be seized by the government, greatly increasing social equality and giving more people a good home."
#,Banprivateeducation,사립학교 금지,"To make sure that school kids learn the right things and are not influenced by strange ideas, banning all private schools may be the  right thing to do. Now that no more so called elite schools exist, every kid has now the same chance to learn and become something great, boosting equality in the process, as children from all classes and income levels mix together."
#,Banprivatehealthcare,민간의료 금지,Why should some people enjoy better or experimental healthcare while others have to toughen it out? Banning private healthcare will make sure that no one gets special treatment while everyone gets what is needed for him or her to get well again. Nobody's health should be determined by the size of their bank balance.
#,Tradeunionbansatcompanies,노동조합 제한,"Companies face a lot of challenges in our modern times. Trade Unions often add to these challenges with their demands and needs, so banning these organizations will help the management focus on making the company competitive and maximize earnings. Of course the workers still have their rights, they just have to earn them without the backing of a wasteful institution."
#,Compulsoryworkfortheunemployed,실업자 강제노동,"Everyone receiving unemployment benefits now has to do some work every week or risk a payment cut in their benefits. This includes public beautification, collecting litter and other tasks that do not risk any jobs. The goal is to make use of this major workforce and get people back into a work routine, hopefully resulting in them getting jobs soon. Nobody should expect to live off the state without working."
#,Punitivewealthtax,징벌적 부유세,"There is nothing wrong with wealth as such, but inequality in our society is bad enough that we must be seen to do something to ensure those with the highest levels of income bear their share of the costs of maintaining a healthy society. It is entirely reasonable to set a tax rate that takes away the majority of income above extremely high levels, as this money is so much more appreciated by those on lower incomes."
#,Publictaxreturns,세금신고서 공개,"Unfortunately some wealthy people in our society try to avoid taxes with illegal tax evasion methods. By  making tax returns public, people can now check if someone is using loopholes or abusing the system. This full disclosure  will encourage support of the system, as well as reducing tax evasion and forcing everyone to be able to justify their income."
#,Compulsorylanguagelessons,외국어강좌 의무수강,"Some people just can't be bothered to learn languages on their own in order to improve their chances on the job market or to understand other people from different nations. Compulsory language lessons will force these people to deal with the world outside, improve our attitudes to foreign visitors, and enable us to better deal with foreign companies, all whilst giving us a greater understanding of other cultures."
#,Banforeignchurchservice,외래종교 예배금지,"Misunderstandings can lead to tragedies and nothing has caused more trouble and deaths in the past than religious conflict. The easiest way to prevent further trouble here is to ban foreign church service outright, avoiding further misunderstandings and unrest."
#,Diversityquotasforcompanies,기업 다양성할당제,"A diverse company is a happy and healthy company. Enabling diversity quotas for companies will force companies hire more people from different ethni backgrounds that have the same qualification, easing racial tensions and making companies a place of equal opportunity."
#,Newcarsubsidies,신차 보조금,"New cars are expensive but also cause less strain on the environment, while old and used cars may be cheaper but also cause more pollution. Using new car subsidies will help people buy new cars that are safer and protect the environment while making motorists happy. New car smell for everyone!"
#,Flagsoneverystreetcorner,국기 의무게양,"To boost patriotism and to induce a sense of belonging into people, putting flags of our country on every street corner will help with our national self esteem. It also looks much better than some burger advertisement."
#,Nationalanthematstartofnews,뉴스 시보 국가 방영,Flashy introductions for news shows may look fancy but it's missing the point: These news are for our people in our country. So we should make that clear and add a flair of patriotism and pride by having the national anthem played at the start of the news instead.
#,Nationalanthemsinschool,학교 국가제창,Young people these days have lost all sense of belonging. Starting the day in school with the national anthem will boost their national pride and help disciplining them. They may not always like it but it's good for them.
#,Compulsorychurchattendance,교회참석 의무화,How can you be saved if you don't listen to what is important and how to live your life? Making church attendance compulsory will save many souls and lead to a better life for the majority of our people. Too bad about those that do not believe in the right thing.
#,Forcepoliticalmilitaryreligiousoath,공무원 및 군인 종교선서 의무화,"Adding religion to oaths given in public by our officials and troops will create a greater sense of honor and security to the public, giving them the feeling that what we are doing is the right thing to do. With righteousness on our side, nothing can go wrong."
#,Publicreligiousbroadcasts,종교방송편성,The voice of faith and reason needs to be heard to have an effect. Adding public religious broadcasts will do a great service in countering all the bad influences of modern mass media as well as making people value the right things again.
#,Bandivorce,이혼 금지,The holy institution of marriage was not meant to be severed by anything other than death. Nowadays people divorce for the silliest things and this threatens whole families and the well being of our children even though often husband and wife just have to toughen through the hard part. Banning divorces will give marriage back it's true meaning.
#,Banhomosexuality,동성애 금지,"According to many religious texts, homosexuality is a sin. In order to combat this, banning homosexuality might convince many sinners to get their life back on track and follow the natural order that God intended."
#,Banlowmpgcars,저효율 자동차 금지,"With gas prices climbing constantly and nature being polluted from all sides, banning cars that use too much fuel may be the right step to protect the environment and help with excessive fuel usage. A big street cruiser might look cool, but it's way too expensive and wasteful and should be banned from the streets. What is good for the enviornment is good for society."
#,Mandatorymicrogeneration,자가전력 의무화,"One of the biggest cost factor in our lives these days is electricity and heat. By making micro generation mandatory, every citizen has the task of generating at least a part of his or her electricity by using solar or wind power, depending on their situation and where they live. A big step towards lowering CO2 Emissions."
#,Punitivetaxonsuperstores,대형마트 징벌과세,"Superstores may be convenient for out citizens, but they have many negative effects, they encourage car journeys, rather than supporting local shops, and their dominance is encouraging a society dominated by big business, with no room for the small family owned store. They should be taxed to reflect the harm they do to the fabric of our society."
#,Limitorbancarsincities,도심지 자동차 통행제한,"Cars are a major factor in air pollution, especially in big cities. Adding a congestion charge or outright banning them from cities will help greatly in fighting air pollution in cities and will increase the use of public transportation. It might look a little extreme to ban cars altogether but it's still better than to breathe in all that poison."
#,Closeairportscompletely,공항 폐쇄,"An extreme measure to fight pollution, closing down all airports will have severe effects on trade, foreign relations and tourism but will cause much less pollution and increase the usage of other transportation. In this modern day, we simply cannot turn a blind eye to the damage to the environment that is being done by our air travel industry. Desperate times call for desperate measures."
#,HealthyEatingCampaign,건강식습관 캠페인,"Through cooking shows, advertisements and specials in newspapers and other media, people are encouraged to be aware of what they eat, what the results of unhealthy food are and how to cook a good meal. This raises the overall health of the people while reducing obesity."
#,CyclingCampaign,자전거 캠페인,"This campaign highlights the many advantages that bikes have in our cities. Whether it is to get through heavy traffic with ease, save money for fuel or to help prevent unnecessary pollution, the bike offers many things for many different people, they just don't know it yet."
#,CarPoolingCampaign,카풀 캠페인,"It often takes some encouragement for people to come together and make better use of the resources at hand. Car-pooling is a good example of that, so this campaign will make people realize how fun and helpful it can be to car-pool, all the while reducing traffic congestion. And if you still end up in a traffic jam, you at least have people to talk to while waiting."
#,KeepTheCountryTidyCampaign,꺠끗한 나라 만들기 캠페인,"A campaign in popular media, designed to make people feel guilty about littering. No matter how much a fine on littering may be, this only works if people are being seen. But a guilty conscience will also work when someone is alone, thus making it far more effective in the long run."
#,TourismAdCampaign,관광홍보 캠페인,"Tourism is not only a source of income for many people and businesses, it also strengthens foreign relations. This campaign will run in foreign countries, showing our most beautiful places, important sights to see, wonderful people to meet, tasty beers to drink and maybe even throws in a few free tickets to museums and shows, all in the hopes of attracting more people to visit us."
#,AlcoholAwarenessCampaign,알콜중독 예방 캠페인,"Alcohol can be dangerous, even in moderation. To raise awareness of that, this campaign will show all the trouble that alcohol can get you into, from ruined friendships over accidents and addiction to sickness and death. Certainly not a happy topic, but it is always better to have your mood dampened a little now and stay sober than to suffer big time later."
#,BusinessStartupCampaign,스타트업 캠페인,"Many people have brilliant ideas, yet only a few of them dare to take the steps necessary to set up their own little business around their idea. This campaign will help these people out, informs them what they need to do, where they need to go and what permits they need to get. This will help a great deal and make self employed people happy."
#,YouthPoliticsCouncil,청년정책위원회,"In any democracy it is of utmost importance to teach our kids how politics work and what can be achieved through it. By establishing Youth Politics Councils, youths can get first hand experience on a local and regional level, see that they can make a difference and perhaps the leaders of tomorrow are being recruited here."
#,NationalArmedForcesWeek,국군의 날 기념식,"Our heroes and protectors need to be recognized. By establishing a National Armed Forces Week, this can be done by celebrating their service for our country, making them feel appreciated and showing the public who these brave men and women are that would risk their lives for our safety."
#,FreeParentingClasses,무료 육아수업,"Having a newborn child can be very taxing and exhausting for new parents. By introducing these free classes, parents can learn how to deal with this situation, how to raise their babies and have a normal life at the same time. It won't make the babies cry less, but it will make the parents more stress resistant and aware, plus they will meet other parents in the same situation."
#,NationalBusinessCouncil,전국경제인협의회,"The establishment of a national business council gives a strong voice to business interests and ensures that the needs of business, both big and small are taken into account. The council serves as a way to promote capitalism and enterprise and get accross the message that the corporate world has much to offer, creates employment and prosperity."
#,SocialJusticeFoundation,사회정의재단,"This policy will establish a foundation that deals with the worries and problems of the poor and under-represented in our country.

#,NeedleExchangeProgram,주사침 교환 프로그램,"Drug addition itself is bad enough already, and dirty or infected needles are an additional danger for drug addicts.

Conservatives may think of this as enabling, but liberals see it as a good way to fight drug abuse in the long run."

#,TradeCouncil,무역위원회,"It has always been a hassle to find trustworthy trading partners in foreign countries.

This will increase international trade and boost the economy."
#,CompulsoryForeignLanguageClasses,외국어 의무교육,"To understand their language is the first important step to understand other people.

#,LaborDayBankHoliday,노동절 공휴일 지정,"This makes Labor Day an official bank holiday, thus reminding citizens that it is not all about money in our life. While this will certainly help to increase the happiness of the working class and everyone who wants to have a good time, it will have a slight negative impact on the economy because a day wasted is money lost."
#,CityFarms,도시 농업,"Many people would love to buy fresh produce from farmers directly, but living in the city, this is often a hassle to drive out to the countryside. So why not bring some farmers to the cities directly? This program helps ambitious farmers to establish farms in or around cities so they can be close to their customers and it will get some of the city kids to consider a career in farming."
#,EcoHomeRegulations,친환경주택 규제,"By setting rules and standards for houses towards eco-friendliness, there are many more things to be considered now when building houses. This may cause a hassle for developers and landlords, but it will help protect the environment in the long run."
#,YoungEntrepreneurScheme,청년 기업가 지원제도,"This Scheme is to help and support young people who are aiming to become businessmen in the future.

#,DiplomaticService,외교통상본부,"Going beyond just having an ambassador and a secretary in a foreign country, employing a full Diplomatic Service may be more expensive, but in the field of international diplomacy, you need to stay on top of things in order to get the best deals for your country and to keep everyone involved and happy. It may take some time to get working effectively, but it will boost foreign relations."
#,WitnessProtectionProgram,증인보호 프로그램,"What good is catching a criminal if the witness to the crime disappears forever?

This will increase the health of our children."
#,BicycleSubsidies,자전거 보조금,"To encourage people to switch from car to bike, a financial motivation is sometimes needed.

And this will result in more people actually using a bike instead of driving a car or staying inside, boosting the health of all citizens by a little."
#,FrequentFlyerTax,항공기 상용고객세,This Tax is charged only for passengers taking multiple flights per year. The idea behind it is to both reduce the amount of air travel (normally for environmental reasons) while still allowing the average-income citizen access to air travel for the occasional holiday.

#,DivertedProfitsTax,우회이익세,"A tax levied on estimates regarding large companies profits earned in this country, regardless of their actual reporting. This is used to prevent multinational companies from claiming that all of the profits they earn are somehow only generated in a tax haven (with little or no corporate taxes), by using cunning accounting trickery. The tax is mostly designed as an incentive to push such companies to play by the spirit as well as the letter of the law."
#,UniversalBasicIncome,보편적 기본소득,"A universal welfare payment given to everyone in society at a flat rate regardless of their income or wealth. This is seen as a way to simplify welfare bureaucracy as well as provide a universal safety net for all citizens, and pave the way for a reduction in work made possible by automation"

#,GayMarriage,동성결혼,"Traditionally, many religions only support marriage between a man and a woman, but more liberal societies are happy to have legally-significant civil partnerships, or even marriages between same sex couples. It's a matter of debate as to whether these should be carried out in churches and by priests."
#,RightToDie,안락사 권리,"Although clearly punishing people for taking their own life is futile, the state often makes it a crime to assist in someone's early death, even if they are in great pain and are unable to carry out the act without help. Religions often take a dim view of suicide, or those assisting in it, regardless of circumstances."
#,RightToPrivacy,프라이버시권,"As more of our lives are led online, and tracking everyone's actions and movements becomes easier, some people argue that the right to privacy both from government and from corporations is essential, despite the impact this would have on corporate profits or law enforcement."
#,GenderTransition,성전환,"Some religious groups, and conservative sections of society argue that there are only two genders, and that changing gender should not be allowed. Others argue that gender has always been fluid and nobody should enforce their gender views on others. Ultimately the state has to take a stance on the extent to which gender transition is officially accepted or rejected."
#,PrisonRegime,교도소 운영정책,"Liberals have the desire to rehabilitate prisoners,  and to ensure they are capable of finding work and avoiding criminal activity on release. Conservatives see prison as a powerful deterrent, where prisoners are punished for what they have done."
#,Reforestation,녹화사업,"As a measure to combat CO2, Tree-planting is relatively uncontroversial. However, some campaigners suggest this is treating the symptom, not the cause, and that CO2 should be reduced at source, not captured afterwards."
#,StateBroadcaster,공영방송,"A state-owned broadcaster can provide impartial and independent news without influence from corporate advertising. This can serve as a defense against biased or fake news, but a compulsory 'TV-tax' is not popular with everybody."
#,WorkersOnBoards,노동이사제,"Unpopular with capitalists, who fear that workers will basically vote themselves higher pay and shorter hours. Socialists and trade unionists see this policy as ensuring a company works for its employees as well as its shareholders."

,,,
#,ExecutiveTermLength,임기,"The length of time that an individual can lead a government for, before a democratic election takes place. Altering the executive term length requires a tremendous amount of political effort. Electing a leader is one of the few events where a nation's people directly exert their influence over the democratic system. It follows that more frequent elections increase the level of democracy in a country."
#,ExecutiveTermLimit,연임 제한,"The number of times that a country's leader can stand for re-election.Term limits act as a method to curb monopolistic governance, where a country's leader becomes officeholder for life. Setting a term limit is a balancing act, as it is an important check to maintain democracy, but can also curtail the benefits of good leadership."
#,JudiciaryIndependence,사법 독립성,"The separation of powers is a model of governance that requires the state to be divided into independent branches of responsibility. The judiciary is made up of a nation's courts of law, which interpret and apply the legislation of a country. Judicial independence is subverted if other branches of government, or private interests, are allowed to exert influence over the courts."
#,PressFreedom,언론의 자유,"The freedom of the press is the freedom of communication and expression through electronic and published media.

Curtailing press freedom negatively impacts democracy, but affords the censor control over access to information."
#,ForeignInvestmentRestrictions,외국인 투자제한 제도,"With foreign investment comes foreign influence.

This curtailment of a global free market is generally unpopular with capitalists, but supported by patriots, who are against any foreign influence exerted on their nation."
#,GameHunting,사냥 제한,"Hunting animals for sport is a contentious pursuit, especially if their numbers in the wild are dwindling. However, wild animals can be considered to be part of a country's natural resources, able to be exploited to create a valuable hunting industry. Regulating game hunting is a way of managing animal populations, protecting other species, and ensuring hunters pay for their privileges. Of course, nature may be best served by an outright ban."
#,AntiCorruptionAgency,반부패기구,"Establishes an anti-corruption enforcement agency. Eliminating corruption may be mandated, but detecting perpetrators and prosecuting them is the only way to stamp out the abuse of power for personal gain. The more resources an anti-corruption agency has, the more powerful the offenders that they can bring to justice."
#,FemaleGenitalMutilationBan,할례 금지,"Genital mutilation is a  ritual inflicted on children (both male and female), and perpetuated by an inherited social and religious acceptance of the practice. Make it clear to all citizens that this violence towards children is no longer acceptable with an outright ban. By allocating resources to this ban's enforcement, its impact will be deeper and more rapidly felt."
#,IntellectualPropertyRights,지적재산권,"Establish the protection of innovative ideas by granting their creators a period of monopoly over their use. Advocates of intellectual property rights claim that invention is incentivized by allowing the owners of ideas to benefit financially. The aim is to promote creativity and progress. However, in practice the use of these rights tends to favor the resource rich, who can pay for rights registration and enforcement."
#,GenderDiscriminationAct,성차별금지법,"Make discrimination against women illegal.

#,TobaccoAwarenessCampaign,금연 캠페인,"Governments have long known the terrible harm that smoking does to its citizens health, but getting them to kick the habit is harder than it sounds. A tradeoff has to be made between reducing the impact on the nations health services versus any tax revenue that smoking brings in."
#,CapitalControls,자본이동 통제,"Restrictions on the flow of capital out of the country. This is a fairly extreme measure to prevent wealth flowing out of a country. Citizens are prevented from taking more than some fixed amount of currency out of the country, in order to prevent capital flight, where the wealthy leave and take their wealth with them. This is very unpopular with the wealthy, and capitalists who see it as a restriction on their freedom of movement and their property rights."
#,BodyCameras,바디캠,"The compulsory wearing of cameras by law enforcement workers is a way to ensure that those workers stick to the law themselves and act in a respectful and honorable way when engaging with members of the public. Without cameras, corruption and bullying complaints against police are not so easily dealt with."
#,SocialCare,사회적 돌봄,"A package of policies which provide care directly to those who need it, from the state. This includes day-care and residential care-home for the elderly who can no longer live alone, care for dementia and support for women's refuges, and for people with mental health difficulties."
#,CongestionCharging,혼잡통행료,"In many large cities, the number of cars travelling in each day is simply unsustainable. Although a fairly blunt instrument, simply charging (through number plate recognition) every vehicle that enters a city each day has proven to be an effective way to reduce congestion in extreme cases."
#,PrisonerVoting,재소자 선거권,"In some countries, all prisoners retain the right to take part in elections, in order to encourage a feeling of still being a part of society and to ensure their welfare is represented. In others, the right to vote is seen as a privilege granted to those who abide by society's rules, and rightfully removed from those who are incarcerated."
#,SelectiveSchooling,비평준화 학교,"The government has to take a view on whether it is best that all students be educated together in the same classroom, regardless of ability, or if it is desirable to place the most talented students in their own classes (which teach faster) or maybe even have dedicated schools for those of the highest ability."
#,Cyberbullyingawarenesscampaign,사이버폭력 인식캠페인,"A program of adverts on TV, radio, online and billboards to warn parents and teachers to look out for signs their children are being bullied online, so that the problem can be spotted early and dealt with before it affects children's mental health."

#,DrugTreatment,마약중독 치료계획,"Punishing people for taking illegal drugs only goes so far. What people really need is treatment, and a long term plan to get people off their dependence on narcotics. These schemes aim to fight the drug issue by reducing demand, instead of limiting supply."
#,StateAirline,항공공사,"So much prestige is wrapped up in a national airline, that literally flies the flag for our country, that its often considered worthwhile to have a state-owned and run airline, maybe run at a loss to encourage tourism, and patriotism."
#,StatePostService,우체국공사,"A state-owned and run postal service can make sense because it is a natural monopoly, and one where a universal service obligation (deliveries to all addresses for the same cost) is generally preferred. The postal service is also a large creator of employment."
#,NuclearFission,원자력 발전소,"Nuclear fission is arguably a renewable source of energy, which dramatically reduces CO2 emissions and reduces oil & gas demand, but can be expensive to produce and comes with problems concerning waste and decommissioning. Environmentalists tend to prefer wind and solar energy instead."
,,,
#,SolidarityTax,연대세,"A top-up to Income Tax that is particular to Germany and which was introduced to help cover the costs associated with the reunification of East and West Germany, and the the need to upgrade infrastructure throughout east Germany."
#,BanCoal,석탄 금지,"In the fight against Climate Change, it is worth remembering that coal is one of the worst possible contributors, and it makes sense that now we have the technology to switch to using renewable energy (or even oil & gas) for our needs, that we pass a law to stop the remaining use of this highly polluting energy source."
#,FinancialTransactionsTax,금융거래세,"Investment is all well and good, but frankly a great deal of the financial transactions in our economy are needless speculating and effectively gambling, which rakes in huge profits for hedge funds and financial firms but creates nothing of value. A small tax on each transaction should raise money AND reduce dangerous speculation."
#,ProportionalFines,재산비례벌금제,"A fine is no deterrent to anti-social behavior at all if it does not scale with income. What may be a colossal and finances-wrecking penalty for some is a mere inconvenience for the ultra-wealthy. By making all fines scale with income, the law can finally be applied equally to all. Is that fair?"
,,,
#,RetirementAge,정년제도,"Where state pensions exist, this policy sets the minimum age at which workers can retire and receive a pension from the state. This is also used as a general benchmark by private businesses when setting their own retirement ages. An early retirement may be desirable for workers, but it impacts the economy and will reduce productivity."
#,CitizenshipForSale,시민권 판매,"Where immigration causes concern about an influx of low paid workers, or those who may be dependent on the state or otherwise represent a  drag on resources, citizenship may be granted to those immigrants who have considerable personal wealth, and thus can prove they will not be a burden. This may appear to be unfair to the majority of would be immigrants without such means."
#,ImmigrationRules,이민법,"Rules on who is, and who is not permitted to migrate to the country. The official rules will have little impact on illegal migration, but nevertheless can have a big impact. Some believe immigration will boost the economy, but those on low pay are often concerned about the competition for jobs."
#,RefugeePolicy,난민 정책,"Most countries accept that they have a moral responsibility to take in migrants from disaster zones or war-torn countries, but there is strong debate on how loose these restrictions and limits should be, especially if climate change and other factors lead to a large rise in global refugees."
,,,
#,banwomendriving,여성운전 금지,"Whether the justification is some passage in a religious text, or just a general cultural attitude that implies women can not or should not control a motor vehicle, this policy represents restrictions on 50% of the population in terms of their freedom to drive. This may be popular with extreme conservative and religious groups but is the extreme opposite of liberalism and gender equality."
#,religioustax,교회세,"Effectively an income tax, or tithe that hands a percentage of peoples earnings directly to religious institutions, for use as they see fit. Hopefully this funnels money into good causes in the same way as charities do, but there is ample room for corruption as unlike the state, religious leaders are not elected by those paying this tax."
#,religiousbanknotes,종교요소 화폐도안,"This policy allows for the use of religious phrasing, or iconography on banknotes and coins. A powerful way to remind citizens that religion is a big part of their lives, and is effectively part of the state. This can cause offense among those who demand separation of church and state."
#,statereligion,국교,"A country can select a specific religion as the official religion for the state, even if it still permits atheism and the worship of other religions. At the least this involves some ceremony, but it can also extend to giving actual political power to unelected church representatives, and involving the church in procedures such as swearing in new elected representatives."
,,,
#,desalination,담수화 시설,"Desalination plants are a way to make water suitable for human consumption using seawater as an input. Although expensive and energy intensive, it is a solution to a water shortage where other methods to prevent the shortage have failed or are insufficient or unpopular."
#,watermeters,수도계량기 의무설치,"The installation of water meters for every household, and the subsequent charging for water based on consumption is one very effective method for reducing water usage and preventing a water shortage, although it can be a long slow process to install meters for every house in the country."
#,plasticstax,플라스틱세,Plastic waste is a major concern among environmentalists due to the very long time that waste plastic can remain in our ecosystem. A tax on plastic production ensures that environmentally friendly alternatives are chosen instead when suitable.
#,packagingtax,포장세,"Even with recycling, the use of excess packaging can be an environmental disaster. One solution is taxing the production or use of packaging materials. This gives business an incentive to work on more efficient designs for their product packaging."
#,unexplainedwealth,재산출처 공개명령제,"A break with the normal assumption of innocence until proven guilty, unexplained wealth orders allow prosecution where a wealthy individual cannot explain where their wealth comes from. Controversial, but an effective policy against career criminals who are clearly profiting from crime, but have covered their tracks well."
#,competitionlaw,독점규제법,"Competition law is basically a trade-off between protecting the ideals of the free market, protecting the consumer from monopolies and encouraging competition on one side, and allowing businesses to grow and for the best companies to succeed on the other."
#,bordernavy,해안방위대,"Border walls cannot work in an ocean, so the equivalent means of deterring illegal immigration for islands and nations with extensive coastline is to invest in patrol boats that intercept and send back any ships carrying illegal immigrants."
#,NuclearWeapons,핵무기,"Nuclear Weapons are the ultimate deterrent against serious military action against a nation. Although there is no reliable defense against nuclear attack, the threat of a retaliatory strike is enough to deter aggression from nation states. To be absolutely sure of a reliable second strike capability, nations that can afford them will opt for nuclear-armed submarines on constant patrol, undetectable by enemy forces, or in theory, space-launched weapons."
#,co2campaign,탄소저감 캠페인,"Government can pass laws, and make spending plans, but it can also tackle the issue of Climate Change by actively urging its citizens to reduce their emissions voluntarily. A public information campaign can persuade citizens not to waste energy and to choose environmentally friendly products, means of transport and even to eat less meat."
